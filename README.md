### ðŸ“š **Project Description**

This project analyzes NHS data on emergency readmissions within 30 days of discharge, focusing on trends across different years, age groups, conditions, and regions. The analysis aims to identify patterns in readmission rates, explore deviations between expected and observed readmissions, and visualize trends using various tools like **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**.
