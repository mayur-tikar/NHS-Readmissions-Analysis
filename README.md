# 🚀 **NHS-Readmissions-Analysis**

---

### 📚 **Project Description**

This project analyzes NHS data on emergency readmissions within 30 days of discharge, focusing on trends across different years, age groups, conditions, and regions. The analysis aims to identify patterns in readmission rates, explore deviations between expected and observed readmissions, and visualize trends using various tools like **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**.

---

### 🛠 **Technologies Used**

- **Python** (Pandas, Seaborn, Jupyter)
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL)
- **Power BI** (for creating interactive dashboards)
- **Git** and **GitHub** (for version control)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (for analysis and visualizations)

---

### 🚀 **Highlights:**
- Analyzed **90,000+ rows** of NHS data using **Python (Pandas, Seaborn)** for cleaning, EDA, and trend visualization
- Used **PostgreSQL** to perform structured SQL-based analysis (avg readmission, expected vs. observed deviation)
- Designed a **Power BI dashboard** showing regional, age-wise, and condition-specific insights
- Built modular project structure with `.env` secrets, reusable functions, and `.ipynb` notebooks for reproducibility

---

### 🔍 **Key Insights:**
- **90+ age group** had the highest readmission rates
- Significant **dip in 2020/21** followed by a rise in 2021/22 across multiple categories (likely pandemic-related)
- **Top conditions**: Chronic pulmonary disease, Angina, Atrial fibrillation
- Regional hotspots: Barnsley, Manchester, Knowsley
